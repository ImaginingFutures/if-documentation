# Providence and Pawtucket2 Installation

Standard installation instructions for Providence and Pawtucket2 are available in the [Collective Access documentation](https://manual.collectiveaccess.org/providence/user/setup/installation.html). The following instructions are specific to the installation of the forked codebase, which follows the [Installing development versions](https://github.com/ImaginingFutures/providence#installing-development-versions) instructions from the Imagining Futures Providence Github repository. Pawtucket2 installation is similar to Providence, so we will only point out the differences.
